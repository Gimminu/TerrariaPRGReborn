[b]Terraria RPG Mod: Ascend Your Potential[/b]

Transform your Terraria experience into a full-fledged RPG adventure. This mod adds a deep leveling system, tiered job classes, custom skills, and dynamic world scaling that keeps the game challenging from Green Slimes to the Moon Lord.

Inspired by classic RPGs, you can build a tanky Knight, a devastating Mage, or a tactical Sniper—and swap stat builds freely to fit your playstyle.

• Reports of crashes while loading other mods, and crashes when this mod is the only one enabled.
