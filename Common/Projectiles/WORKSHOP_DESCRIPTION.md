# Terraria RPG Mod: Ascend Your Potential

Transform your Terraria experience into a full-fledged RPG adventure. This mod adds a deep leveling system, tiered job classes, custom skills, and dynamic world scaling that keeps the game challenging from Green Slimes to the Moon Lord.

Inspired by classic RPGs, you can build a tanky Knight, a devastating Mage, or a tactical Sniper—and swap stat builds freely to fit your playstyle.

## 🌟 What’s New (QoL & Fixes)
*   **Quest UI toggle + free layout:** Hide the quest panel anytime (Quest UI toggle, default key: `O`, or Mod Config), move it independently from the main HUD, and resize it.
*   **UI layout mode:** Move/scale key RPG UI pieces (HUD, skill bar, quest UI) without touching vanilla UI positions.
*   **RPG Merchant AI fix:** Merchant now uses town NPC AI (no slime hopping). If you still see odd movement, reset config and respawn the NPC.
*   **UI click alignment:** Fixed scaled UI hitboxes so buttons line up with the visuals.
*   **Level label overlap:** Fixed duplicate level/difficulty text on segmented enemies. Temporary toggle still available in Client Config.

## 🛡️ Class & Job System
Start as a **Novice** and advance through tiers:
*   **Tier 1 (Lv 10+):** Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Summoner.
*   **Tier 2 (Lv 50+):** Knight, Berserker, Sniper, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and more.
*   **Tier 3 (Endgame):** Final advancements (Coming Soon).

Visit the **RPG Merchant** (spawns after Level 10) for Job Advancement Scrolls and skill books.

## 📊 Deep Stat Customization
Build with a **12-Stat System**:
*   **Core:** Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Focus.
*   **Survival:** Vitality (HP), Defense, Fortitude (Status Resist).
*   **Utility:** Agility (Speed/Dodge), Wisdom (Mana), Stamina, Luck, Rogue.

Each level grants **Stat Points** plus **Auto-Growth** based on your class so you scale naturally while still steering your build.

## ⚔️ Skills & Combat
*   **Active Skills:** New skill hotbar for offensive/buff skills.
*   **Dash System:** Dedicated dash (Default: `F`) using Stamina with i-frames.
*   **Sweet Spot XP:** Bonus XP for fighting near-level enemies; chain kills for combo multipliers.

## ⚖️ Dynamic World Scaling
*   **World Level:** Rises as you defeat bosses; keeps progression meaningful.
*   **Monster & Projectile Scaling:** Enemies and their projectiles scale by world level and biome difficulty.
*   **Mod Compatibility:** Designed to pair with big content mods (Calamity, Thorium, etc.).

## 🖥️ Modern UI
*   **RPG HUD:** HP/Mana/Stamina/XP bars with clean readability.
*   **Character Menu:** Press **`C`** (default) to manage stats, job info, and skills.
*   **Floating Combat Text:** XP gain, crits, and elemental feedback.

## 🎮 How to Start
1.  Create a Level 1 Novice.
2.  Fight to gain XP (best rewards from near-level enemies).
3.  Allocate Stat Points via the Menu key.
4.  At Level 10, let the **RPG Merchant** move in and buy a "First Job Scroll."

## ⚙️ Configuration
*   **XP Sharing:** Nearby players share XP.
*   **Client Config:** Toggle damage numbers, XP text, and RPG UI elements.
*   **Server Config:** Adjust leveling speed, stat point gain, and auto-growth.

## 📝 Compatibility
*   Calamity: Fully compatible (XP and scaling adjust).
*   Thorium: Fully compatible.
*   Fargo’s Souls: Compatible.

### ⚠️ Balance Note
Enemies are tougher to match your infinite scaling. Expert/Master recommended.
