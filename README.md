# Terraria RPG Mod: Ascend Your Potential

Transform your Terraria experience into a full-fledged RPG adventure. This mod adds a deep leveling system, tiered job classes, custom skills, and dynamic world scaling that keeps the game challenging from Green Slimes to the Moon Lord.

Inspired by classic RPGs, you can build a tanky Knight, a devastating Mage, or a tactical Sniper—and swap stat builds freely to fit your playstyle.

## ⚠️ Known Issues (v0.1.8)
- Some players report freezing on world load (NPCs/player/time stop); may require Alt+F4.
- Reports of crashes while loading other mods, and crashes when this mod is the only one enabled.
- Boss summoning item not spawning the boss in some setups.
- Investigating now—please post logs and steps to reproduce. Hotfix in progress.

## Bug Reports (help us fix this fast)
- Steps to reproduce (single player/multiplayer, other mods enabled).
- Your tModLoader version + mod version.
- Logs: Settings > Open Logs, then attach `client.log` (and `client-crash.log` if present).

## 🌟 What's New (QoL & Fixes)
- **Multiplayer XP Fix:** Fixed XP not dropping in multiplayer when hosting.
- **Optional Systems:** Server admins can now disable Job/Class system and Skill system via Server Config. Client-side UI visibility toggles for Job and Skill tabs.
- **Quest UI toggle + free layout:** Hide the quest panel anytime (Quest UI toggle, default key: O, or Mod Config), move it independently from the main HUD, and resize it.
- **UI layout mode:** Move/scale key RPG UI pieces (HUD, skill bar, quest UI) without touching vanilla UI positions.
- **RPG Merchant AI fix:** Merchant now uses town NPC AI (no slime hopping). If you still see odd movement, reset config and respawn the NPC.
- **UI click alignment:** Fixed scaled UI hitboxes so buttons line up with the visuals.
- **Level label overlap:** Fixed duplicate level/difficulty text on segmented enemies. Temporary toggle still available in Client Config.
- **Configuration fixes:** All scaling and XP settings now properly apply. Added boss-specific HP/damage scaling, defense scaling, and improved XP controls.

## 🛡️ Class & Job System
Start as a **Novice** and advance through tiers:
- **Tier 1 (Lv 10+):** Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Summoner.
- **Tier 2 (Lv 50+):** Knight, Berserker, Sniper, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and more.

## 📊 Deep Stat Customization
Build with a **12-Stat System**:
- **Core:** Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Focus.
- **Survival:** Vitality (HP), Defense, Fortitude (Status Resist).
- **Utility:** Agility (Speed/Dodge), Wisdom (Mana), Stamina, Luck, Rogue.

Each level grants **Stat Points** plus **Auto-Growth** based on your class so you scale naturally while still steering your build.

## ⚔️ Skills & Combat

- **Dash System:** Dedicated dash (Default: F) using Stamina with i-frames.
- **Sweet Spot XP:** Bonus XP for fighting near-level enemies; chain kills for combo multipliers.

## ⚖️ Dynamic World Scaling
- **World Level:** Rises as you defeat bosses; keeps progression meaningful.
- **Monster & Projectile Scaling:** Enemies and their projectiles scale by world level and biome difficulty.
- **Mod Compatibility:** Designed to pair with big content mods (Calamity, Thorium, etc.).

## 🖥️ Modern UI
- **RPG HUD:** HP/Mana/Stamina/XP bars with clean readability.
- **Character Menu:** Press **C** (default) to manage stats, job info, and skills.
- **Floating Combat Text:** XP gain, crits, and elemental feedback.

## 🎮 How to Start
1. Create a Level 1 Novice.
2. Fight to gain XP (best rewards from near-level enemies).
3. Allocate Stat Points via the Menu key.
4. At Level 10, let the **RPG Merchant** move in and buy a "First Job Scroll."

## ⚙️ Configuration
